# Hi, I'm Jai

Music major turned ML engineer. 
I went from touring internationally with orchestras, to debugging transformers, turns out the skills transfer 
better than you'd think.

**What I'm into:** Audio ML • AI alignment research • Applied ML

Currently: Teaching machines to listen to music the way humans do.

🏆 Won 2 hackathons, hopefully more in the future • 🎵 Still play piano (we haven't been replaced yet)
