# Hi, I'm Jai

**Quick facts:** Music major turned ML engineer. I toured internationally
with orchestras, then decided debugging neural nets was the next logical step.

**What I'm into:** Audio ML • AI alignment research • Applied ML

**Current project:** AI Piano coach that teaches musicality, not just which notes to play.
Like having a conservatory professor in your pocket, minus the intimidation factor.

🏆 Won 2 hackathons, hopefully more in the future • 🎵 Still play piano (we haven't been replaced yet)

*"Discipline from music + curiosity from ML = interesting problems solved"*
