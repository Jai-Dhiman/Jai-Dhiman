# Hi, I'm Jai 👋

**Quick facts:** Piano performance major turned ML engineer. I toured internationally 
with orchestras, then decided debugging neural nets was the next logical step.

**What I'm into:** Audio ML • AI alignment research • Systems that make expertise accessible

**Current project:** Built an AI piano teacher that gives feedback across 16 dimensions. 
It's like having a conservatory professor in your pocket, minus the intimidation factor.

🏆 Won 2 SF hackathons • 🔧 Contributed to LangChain, JAX/Flax, HuggingFace  
📍 San Francisco • 🎵 Still play piano (the humans haven't been replaced yet)

*"Discipline from music + curiosity from ML = interesting problems solved"*
